Do you hate having to indent your Stack Overflow code with four spaces?

***I do!***

Instead, prepare your Stack Overflow question or answer using [this
editor][editor], and indicate code blocks using backticks, just like you
do on GitHub! Like this:

    ```
    [1, 2, 3].map { |x| x**2 }
    puts "the #{solution}"
    ```

With the click of a button, your GitHub-style markdown will be
automatically converted to Stack Overflow-style markdown and copied to
your clipboard. Paste it into Stack Overflow, and you're done!
